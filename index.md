**Assistant Professor, Department of Statistics**


**University of Kentucky**



I earned my Ph.D. from the Department of Statistics at the George R. Brown School of Engineering, Rice University. My professional journey includes serving as a senior machine learning engineer at TikTok, where I specialized in predictive modeling, video understanding, and anomaly detection. Additionally, I've contributed as a research scientist at Petuum Inc., concentrating on machine learning and medical imaging. I've also held a significant role as a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, delving into statistical modeling on omics data. Further enriching my experience, I completed a research internship at IBM Research, focusing on genomic data compression. My research interests encompass methodological studies for machine learning, statistical computing, graphical models, and Bayesian inference, with a specific focus on biomarker detection in imaging genomics, machine intelligence, and precision medicine.
